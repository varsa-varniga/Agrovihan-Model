Apply foliar spray of seaweed extract (3-5ml/L) with micronutrients to improve heat tolerance and prepare plants for upcoming flowering. The strong wind (16 km/h) increases transpiration demands - apply anti-transpirant spray on field perimeters most exposed to wind. Perform light hoeing to break soil crust from rainfall while simultaneously controlling early weed emergence - crucial timing as groundnut is poor competitor at this stage. Apply calcium ammonium nitrate as nitrogen source (15-20 kg N/ha) to support vegetative growth while improving calcium availability for upcoming pod development. Install yellow sticky traps (5/ha) to monitor thrips population which vectors peanut bud necrosis virus. Create windbreaks using tall grasses or temporary netting on prevailing wind direction side.

Millet,Harvest,36,69,36,14,"For millet harvesting under very high temperature (36°C) and moderate humidity (69%), schedule cutting operations during early morning when grain moisture is optimal to prevent shattering losses. The significant rainfall (36mm) necessitates 2-3 days of clear weather before harvesting to achieve optimal grain moisture content of 18-20%. The moderate wind (14 km/h) helps in field drying but increases risk of lodging in mature crops - cut affected patches first. For machine harvesting, adjust cutter bar height considering variability in plant height from heat stress during grain filling. Use tarps under threshing operations to recover scattered grains. Clean equipment thoroughly between fields to prevent mixing of varieties. Bag harvested grain in jute rather than plastic sacks to allow moisture equilibration. Transport during morning hours and initiate artificial drying immediately if moisture exceeds 12%. Apply food-grade diatomaceous earth to grain if immediate drying isn't possible. Monitor for grain borers which proliferate rapidly under warm storage conditions - fumigate storage areas with approved compounds before storing new grain.",0
Maize,Germination,35,74,25,19,"For maize seed germination under high temperature (35°C) with moderate humidity (74%), implement precision planting techniques. Plant seeds in evening hours when soil has cooled from daytime heat for better germination uniformity. The moderate rainfall (25mm) creates favorable moisture conditions, but strong wind (19 km/h) will quickly dry soil surface - apply mulch immediately after planting in strips along rows. Treat seeds with metalaxyl + thiram combination to prevent seedling diseases under fluctuating soil moisture. Create microcatchments around each planting spot to harvest and direct rainfall toward germinating seeds. Install temporary windbreaks using 40% shade net along field perimeters perpendicular to wind direction. The combination of high temperature and moderate rainfall creates ideal conditions for soil insect pests - apply fipronil granules in seed furrows.

Sugarcane,Harvest,33,71,29,6,"For sugarcane harvesting at high temperature (33°C) with moderate humidity (71%) and rainfall (29mm), schedule cutting operations during early morning hours when sucrose concentration is highest. Measure brix levels with a hand refractometer before harvesting - optimal levels are 18-20%. The light wind (6 km/h) is favorable for worker comfort but insufficient for quick drying of harvested material - arrange for prompt transportation to processing facility within 12 hours to prevent sucrose inversion. Cut stalks at ground level using sharp tools to prevent ragged ends which invite pathogen entry in ratoon crop. Detrash and detop efficiently, removing all dead leaves and immature top portions. The moderate rainfall makes fields slightly wet - adjust machinery ground pressure to prevent soil compaction which affects ratoon performance. Apply copper oxychloride to cut ratoon stubble to prevent pathogen entry. Maintain cutting tool hygiene using 10% bleach solution between fields to prevent disease spread. Record field yield data precisely to evaluate variety performance under the season's temperature and rainfall patterns for future planning.",0

Sugarcane,Harvest,34,65,22,17,"For sugarcane harvesting under high temperature (34°C) and moderate humidity (65%), optimize cutting timing based on sucrose accumulation - conduct pre-harvest sampling using hand refractometer at different field sections to identify priority areas. With lower rainfall (22mm) and strong wind (17 km/h), fields will be relatively dry - adjust harvester cutting height to 2-3cm above ground to avoid excessive soil intake while preserving ratoon potential. The combination of heat and wind accelerates moisture loss from cut stalks - organize harvesting in blocks that can be transported within 8 hours to prevent significant yield loss through desiccation and sucrose inversion. Use clean, sharp tools to make smooth cuts that heal properly for good ratoon establishment. The strong wind increases fire risk if burning is practiced - maintain wide firebreaks and have water tankers on standby. Schedule harvesting progression based on variety maturity indices rather than field proximity. Apply potassium phosphite to cut ratoon stubble immediately after harvest to promote rapid sprouting under heat stress. Maintain detailed harvest records including brix readings, stalk count, and biomass to evaluate variety performance under the season's conditions.",0

Sugarcane,Harvest,33,71,29,6,"For sugarcane harvesting at high temperature (33°C) with moderate humidity (71%) and rainfall (29mm), schedule cutting operations during early morning hours when sucrose concentration is highest. Measure brix levels with a hand refractometer before harvesting - optimal levels are 18-20%. The light wind (6 km/h) is favorable for worker comfort but insufficient for quick drying of harvested material - arrange for prompt transportation to processing facility within 12 hours to prevent sucrose inversion. Cut stalks at ground level using sharp tools to prevent ragged ends which invite pathogen entry in ratoon crop. Detrash and detop efficiently, removing all dead leaves and immature top portions. The moderate rainfall makes fields slightly wet - adjust machinery ground pressure to prevent soil compaction which affects ratoon performance. Apply copper oxychloride to cut ratoon stubble to prevent pathogen entry. Maintain cutting tool hygiene using 10% bleach solution between fields to prevent disease spread. Record field yield data precisely to evaluate variety performance under the season's temperature and rainfall patterns for future planning.",0

Sugarcane,Harvest,34,65,22,17,"For sugarcane harvesting under high temperature (34°C) and moderate humidity (65%), optimize cutting timing based on sucrose accumulation - conduct pre-harvest sampling using hand refractometer at different field sections to identify priority areas. With lower rainfall (22mm) and strong wind (17 km/h), fields will be relatively dry - adjust harvester cutting height to 2-3cm above ground to avoid excessive soil intake while preserving ratoon potential. The combination of heat and wind accelerates moisture loss from cut stalks - organize harvesting in blocks that can be transported within 8 hours to prevent significant yield loss through desiccation and sucrose inversion. Use clean, sharp tools to make smooth cuts that heal properly for good ratoon establishment. The strong wind increases fire risk if burning is practiced - maintain wide firebreaks and have water tankers on standby.
